it is the way of integrating the code from git and create the artifact
in b/w hgetting the code sourcr to artifact some checks should be done with installing the dependencies 
Like running testcases,scans.
CI-we just automate the process here
--------------
jenkins ---plain server
plugin-----installing what we need
jobs------ we call everything as job
bulid------we call a job after trigger 
agent -----run jobs across multiple machines.
           The agent tells Jenkins:Where to run the code.
		   What kind of environment or label is required.
--------------------------------
sample line by line==
pipeline {                            =this is pipeline
    agent any                         =
    stages {                          = only stages 
        stage('Hello') {              = each seperate stage
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, world!'  = what to run here command
            }
        }
    }
}
-------------------------------------------
Triggers=
##Set up automated actions that start your build based on specific events, like code changes or scheduled times.##
1)Build after other projects are built=Triggers this job only after specified other jobs have completed, often used in pipelines.
2)Build periodically=SCHEDULED TIMES USING CRON SYNTAX,WITH/WITHOUT OF CODE CHANGES
3)GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling==Triggers a build when GitHub sends a webhook (on push or pull request) to Jenkins.
4)Poll SCM=CHECKS THE GIT FOR CHANGES AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS. IF CHANGES ARE FOUND BUILD IS TRIGEERED IF NOT STANDBY
5)Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)= Allows builds to be triggered via a URL with an authentication token

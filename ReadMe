it is the way of integrating the code from git and create the artifact
in b/w hgetting the code sourcr to artifact some checks should be done with installing the dependencies 
Like running testcases,scans.
CI-we just automate the process here
--------------
jenkins ---plain server
plugin-----installing what we need
jobs------ we call everything as job
bulid------we call a job after trigger 
agent -----run jobs across multiple machines.
           The agent tells Jenkins:Where to run the code.
		   What kind of environment or label is required.
--------------------------------
sample line by line==
pipeline {                            =this is pipeline
    agent any                         =
    stages {                          = only stages 
        stage('Hello') {              = each seperate stage
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, world!'  = what to run here command
            }
        }
    }
}
-------------------------------------------
=======
CONTINUES INTEGRATION==
##it is way of INTEGRATION the code from source and create artifact 
## in between creating and source we have to install dependecies
1)git 2)npm install 3)sonar-scan 4)zip the file
## instead of the installing the dependecies we can use the CONTINUES integration 
## so we can use jenkins her or github actions
